Using any programming language you're comfortable with, write the required 
class(es) to implement
a simple singly-linked list.

Write two functions to reverse the order of a singly-linked list using 
your implementation.
You must provide:
 1. An iterative reverse.
 2. A recursive reverse.
 3. A full suite of automated tests.
